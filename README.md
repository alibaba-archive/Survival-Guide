# Survival Guide

Teambition cannot resist tempting to create better things. Things that revolutionise the way people work; that make things better; that rejoice people who work.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that information belongs to be free; that companies default to transparency; that innovation deserves being better rewarded.

Rapidly growing, we find something has been rooted here. Thatâ€™s why we jotted down Teambition Guideline series to make it graspable.

[Member Guide](./member-guide.md) details the basic and most important things on working in Teambition. You will find how wages are calculated based on your education and working experiences; What perks you will receive in Teambition. To find out the details, please read them. Want to know the workflows and our style guides? Check out [Teambition Standards](https://github.com/teambition/standard) for more info.

Other guides are coming soon.
